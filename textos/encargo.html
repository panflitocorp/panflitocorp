      Arrival<br>
      <br>

      An arrival. Heard from the distance. Humanity was changed forever. Falling
      down into spiral patterns. Looking up through the water of a river stream. Deaf, blind
      and without reservations. Plastered into an old rug. A window, a backroom to the end of
      time. We look up in search of the sun. A thousand masters with dark chins. We are
      awakened and returned to the stars. Hoping not to be forgotten.<br>
      <br>

      Glory to Ashes<br>
      <br>

      From the caves of mars into a straight line of opposite polarities. Emptiness
      turned into delicate breaths. The sun is still imploding. No wind blows while we put
      ourselves to sleep. We spit on pearls to make space for the echos. They surround us. The
      spheres, they dream for us. Grass surrounds us, grows over our faces. A black sky over a
      great desert.<br>
      <br>

      Edge of Dawn<br>
      <br>

      Pastoral scene from our teenage dreams. A new moon on our bitter land. Strange
      pause, to think things over. What we knew then, contained in a clear shell. A constant
      reminder of how we were speaking. Of our mundane belongings. Hollow rocks and
      magnetic fields erode the horizon. With its many different faces. Destined to collide
      while being put to rest.<br>

    <h2>Enjoy What's Left</h2>

    1. Arrival<br>
    <span class="sangria">A</span> new shift starts in the control room. The oracle stands on a magnetic vessel. Heat
    permeates the atmosphere. The alarms are about to go off. All electronics are stuck. They
    will soon be one with the silent cave. Cables send their last errands across the sea and into
    the sky. The first sphere runs its first command. A totem of light and exhilaration. The stone
    grows cold. To catch a glimpse of the arrival.<br>
    <br>

    2. Alchemy<br>
    <span class="sangria">The</span> static field is replaced with a light breeze. Fibers become branches of the forest's new
    spring. Mountains are crowned with green. New energy within the absence of extraction. We
    have marked our machines with their words and arranged new compounds. The inside of a
    bolt that had nature's own acceleration. The new alphabet of infinity.<br>
    <br>

    3. Waste<br>
    <span class="sangria">Engines</span> start in the midst of a storm. There is new behaviour in the frontier. We seek to
    communicate our needs and for them to be understood. The birth of a misunderstanding. We
    are accused of circling the sun. Debris sink into the ocean as it becomes an expanding
    diorama. The temperature spirals down. Again the word is spread. This time not to be
    spoken. It bleeds like a disease on a crystal shell. It cracks beneath our ships as we stretch
    our hands to no avail.<br>
    <br>

    4. Pearly Gates<br>
    <span class="sangria">Resistance</span> strikes. Orbiting dead space. A single shot to reverse the order of nature. We
    give our backs to the curvature of the earth and set the plan in motion. An artifact renders it
    motionless, a window of opportunity. Synchronicity is broken. The needle punctures the crust
    of the third sphere making it sick. A mutant to their kind with an inseminated marrow bone.
    To die by our own hand rather than succumb to uncertainty.<br>
    <br>

    5. White Flag<br>
    <span class="sangria">Set</span> on a spike in a reservoir is one of the oracles. Walls have grown tall. We are scraping
    the bottom of the barrel. Ripples of contaminated wind erode our windmills. Electric towers
    and hollow trees. Still standing but surrendered. It takes one last drop for the skeleton to
    crumble. The spear has now cracked it open. The fall breaks it in half. Two circular windows are opened to empty spaces. The prison where light had escaped from is now an empty
    vessel made of stone.<br>
    <br>

    6. Lucid Beach<br>
    <span class="sangria">The</span> red ocean is cemented on the beach. The lighthouse means refuge. Spread under the
    earth's crust. The population is unconsolable. Frozen winds carry radiation. Without high or
    low tides time stands still. The beach becomes a slaughterhouse. Food is scavenged. Flesh
    decays. Trapped on an island with poisoned water.<br>
    <br>

    7. Giants<br>
    <span class="sangria">It</span> has long started. Morphing passes unnoticed before our eyes. The fever dream is
    decomposing. Rotten bodies are robbed out of their gifts. There is one last ride to the train
    station. Dunes scrape the horizon as the wagon reaches the end of the line. Rubble over the
    desert. Still pumping the carbon print. The only true belief is the spine we carry on our backs.<br>
    <br>

    8. Rust<br>
    <span class="sangria">Sand</span> covers the tracks. The city disappears under the sand. Dust is brought in through the
    broken windows. One flew over the ghost station. The last remaining shadow of a skeleton.
    The forgotten ruins of our dreams.<br>
    <br>

    9. New Born<br>
    <span class="sangria">The</span> laboratory holds on. Machines are surrounded by static puddles. Mercury has bled
    through the cracks and is now dripping. Dawn in the temple of silence. The last sphere
    trembles as it shines one last time. The ring's gravity center breaks and falls. Still waiting for
    completion. The code is interrupted and the work is unmade. The message rolls over and
    waits till dusk.<br>
    <br>

    <h2>Okytomo and the Vertigo of the Anomaly</h2>

    <span class="sangria">Motivated</span> by absolute absence, the world encapsulated the ephemeral into a laid out image.
    With it came the many problems of representation. The emerging motions of imagining were
    canceled by the device. In search of relief, we swapped the uncertain form for what we knew
    was finite within the spectral plasma.<br>
    <span class="sangria">Every</span> experimental gesture not only has the potential to reveal a new notion but can aim
    towards hidden scenarios. It is the act of placing the strange within nearby limits. We recognize
    few traces of what could be habitable surroundings. But they carry along the flush of enigma,
    doubt and suspicion. This is 0kytomoâ€™s line of work. In these scenes, we perceive the anomaly
    drifting away from evident appearances.The latent state of imminence returns to the picture. It is
    an invitation from both planes to be immersed in the constant shaping of reality.<br>
    <span class="sangria">Newborn</span> symbols turn into an expanded scene. They are the flashing signals that transcend the
    spectrum to mold the simultaneous form. From the depths of the image different layers of time
    unfold. We find pure perception. The mind is deserted while the spirit peeks through the
    keyhole, longing for fantasy. The rising zone is offered to the exultant eye that walks towards the
    image and is merged to it. Praising the split of the world's eternal movement.<br>
    <span class="sangria">Soon,</span> the spectral is restored and with it, the stroll of present experience. We are faced with a
    privileged event. A revelation of vital meaning to our temporary and furious tense of daily abyss.<br>
